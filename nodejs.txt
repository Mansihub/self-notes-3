Node.js is not a language; it's a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Node.js vs. JavaScript

- **JavaScript**:
  - A programming language used primarily for client-side scripting in web browsers.
  - Can manipulate HTML, CSS, and handle user interactions within a web page.

- **Node.js**:
  - A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.
  - Built on the V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine used by Google Chrome).
  - Provides a set of APIs to interact with the file system, network, and other server-side operations that are not available in browser-based JavaScript.

### Key Features of Node.js

1. **Module System**:
   - Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, where you can use `require` to import modules.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const fs = require('fs'); // fs is the file system module
     const express = require('express'); // express is a web framework module
     ```

2. **Asynchronous and Non-blocking I/O**:
   - Node.js is designed to handle many connections concurrently.
   - It uses non-blocking I/O operations to handle multiple requests efficiently.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Node.js applications are built around an event-driven architecture.
   - The server can respond to multiple events, such as incoming HTTP requests, without waiting for any single operation to complete.

### How Node.js Works with JavaScript

- **JavaScript Code**:
  - You write JavaScript code, which includes logic for handling HTTP requests, database operations, and more.
  - Node.js executes this JavaScript code on the server.

- **Node.js APIs**:
  - Node.js provides additional APIs (beyond what's available in the browser) to handle server-specific tasks.
  - Example APIs include `fs` for file system operations, `http` for creating servers, and `net` for network communications.

### Example to Illustrate

#### JavaScript in the Browser:
```javascript
// Example of JavaScript running in the browser
document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
```
- This code runs in the browser, manipulating the DOM and handling user interactions.

#### JavaScript with Node.js:
```javascript
// Example of JavaScript running with Node.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from the server!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
- This code runs on the server, using Node.js to handle HTTP requests and send responses.

### Clarifying the Misunderstanding

- **Node.js is Not a Language**:
  - Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to use JavaScript on the server side.
  - It provides the capability to use `require` and other server-specific functionalities.

- **JavaScript Language**:
  - The language used in both browser-based and Node.js environments is JavaScript.
  - The syntax and core language features are the same, but Node.js provides additional APIs for server-side operations.

In summary, Node.js allows JavaScript to be used beyond the browser, enabling server-side development with a unified language for both client and server code. The `require` function and other features provided by Node.js make it powerful for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
