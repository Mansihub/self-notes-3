Explaining closures can be straightforward if you break it down into simple concepts. Here’s how you can do it in an interview, using a basic example in JavaScript:

### What is a Closure?

A **closure** is a function that "remembers" the environment in which it was created, even after that environment has finished executing. This allows it to access variables from its outer scope.

### Simple Example

Let’s use a simple example to demonstrate:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // This variable is in the outer function's scope

    return function() { // This inner function forms a closure
        count += 1; // It can access and modify the 'count' variable
        return count;
    };
}

const counter = createCounter(); // 'counter' is now a closure
console.log(counter()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter()); // Output: 2
console.log(counter()); // Output: 3
```

### Breaking it Down

1. **Outer Function**: `createCounter` is the outer function. It defines a variable `count` initialized to 0.
  
2. **Inner Function**: The function returned by `createCounter` is the inner function. It can access `count` even after `createCounter` has finished executing.

3. **Closure**: When we call `createCounter()`, it returns the inner function, which is stored in `counter`. The inner function "remembers" its environment, which includes `count`.

4. **Using the Closure**: Each time we call `counter()`, it increments `count` and returns its new value, demonstrating how the closure allows access to `count` even after the outer function has finished.

### Summary

You can say:
"A closure lets a function access variables from its outer scope, even after that outer function has finished running. This is useful for creating private variables or maintaining state, like in our counter example."

This simple explanation should give the interviewer a clear understanding of what closures are and how they work in practice!
