var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);

Now, your computer works as a server!

If anyone tries to access your computer on port 8080, they will get a "Hello World!" message in return!
Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module.

If the response from the HTTP server is supposed to be displayed as HTML, you should include an HTTP header with the correct content type:

var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.write('Hello World!');
  res.end();
}).listen(8080);

The first argument of the res.writeHead() method is the status code, 200 means that all is OK, the second argument is an object containing the response headers.

The function passed into the http.createServer() has a req argument that represents the request from the client.
This object has a property called "url" which holds the part of the url that comes after the domain name

var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.write(req.url);
  res.end();
}).listen(8080);

for url:http://localhost:8080/winter

the above code will produce this result:/winter

There are built-in modules to easily split the query string into readable parts, such as the URL module.
var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  var q = url.parse(req.url, true).query;
  var txt = q.year + " " + q.month;
  res.end(txt);
}).listen(8080);

The address:http://localhost:8080/?year=2017&month=July

Will produce this result:2017 July

A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.

Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project.
