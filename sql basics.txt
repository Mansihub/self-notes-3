SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
update ad_attribute_list set enity_name='rench'--will set for all rows in table
(remember to apply where condition in above query if required)
drop table table_name;
delete from table_name;
(both of the above query will delete the enntire table)'if we want to delete a particular row thenn,
delete from table_name where condition;
insert into table_name values('all','col','val','will','be','filled');
Insert into table_name(entity_name,display_name,required) values ('fench','truekey','false')
--column name need not too be in string
we do not insert any value in auto-increment field..it will automatically be updated.


for inserting multiple rows in a table:
Insert into table_name(entity_name,display_name,required)
values 
('fench','truekey','false'),
('fench','truekey','false'),
('fench','truekey','false'),
below two to study:
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

 A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:
DELETE FROM Customers;

To delete the table completely, use the DROP TABLE statement:
DROP TABLE Customers;

The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.

aggregate funcitons are:min,max,count,sum,avg
aggregate function ignore null values except the count function.

When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. To give the column a descriptive name, use the AS keyword:
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;
