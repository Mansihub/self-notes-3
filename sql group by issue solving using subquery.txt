Resolving group by issue:

first version:

SELECT 
    flow.flow_id, 
    flow.flow_structure_data, 
    flow.flow_description,
    flow.flow_name,
    flow.flow_status, 
    flow.CreatedDate, 
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS totalCount 
FROM 
    flow 
JOIN 
    user_flow_access ON flow.flow_id = user_flow_access.flow_id 
WHERE 
    expiration_date IS NULL 
    AND user_flow_access.username = ? 
    AND SUBSTRING_INDEX(flow.username, '@', -1) = SUBSTRING_INDEX(user_flow_access.username, '@', -1) 
    AND flow.flow_status IN (?) 
    AND flow_name LIKE ? 
GROUP BY 
    flow.flow_id 
ORDER BY 
    flow.${order} ${sort} 
LIMIT 
    ? OFFSET ?

In above query we have group by flow.flowid ... if column not included in geoup by then they should be included with aggregated fucntion but we can not apply any aggregated function in flow_structure as it includes an object so we can not apply maths function like max,count,min,sum so we will need a subquery to handle the case where we want to include grup by oly flow.flowid.so,we converted query to other form:
